**Usage:** After running any assessment or analysis command, use this to persist results to Datadog.

**Parameters to collect from user:**
- **Report type**: assessment, investigation, incident-postmortem, cost-analysis, gap-analysis
- **Title**: Custom notebook title (default: auto-generate from type + date)
- **Include graphs**: true/false (add relevant metrics visualizations)
- **Time range**: 1h, 4h, 1d, 7d, 30d (for metric graphs)

**Notebook Configuration:**

**Type mapping:**
- `assessment` → "report"
- `investigation` → "investigation"
- `incident-postmortem` → "postmortem"

- `gap-analysis` → "runbook"

**Cell composition:**
1. **Header** (markdown): Title, date, assessment metadata
2. **Summary** (markdown): Key findings and scores
3. **Metrics** (optional): Based on report type
   - Assessment: Infrastructure metrics, log status, span count
   - Investigation: Service-specific metrics, error rates
   - Cost: Cloud cost metrics over time
4. **Details** (markdown): Full analysis with tables
5. **Recommendations** (markdown): Action items and next steps
6. **Footer** (markdown): Generated by SRE Spec Kit + timestamp
