## What is This?

The **SRE Spec Kit for Datadog** is a command-driven framework that helps SRE and platform engineering teams:

1. **Assess** current Datadog observability maturity (Levels 0-5)
2. **Identify** gaps in monitoring, tagging, cost optimization, and incident management
3. **Plan** step-by-step upgrades to advance SRE practices
4. **Document** investigations, postmortems, and reports using proven templates
5. **Track** progress over time with repeatable assessments

### Why Use This Kit?

- ✅ **Objective Assessment**: Uses real Datadog data via MCP (not surveys)
- ✅ **Industry Standards**: Based on SRE best practices and Datadog recommendations
- ✅ **Actionable Plans**: Get specific, prioritized steps to improve
- ✅ **Save Time**: Pre-built commands and templates (not starting from scratch)
- ✅ **Track Progress**: Repeatable assessments show maturity growth

## 💡 Best Practices

### Assessment Best Practices
1. **Start with Level 0** - Don't skip the foundation
2. **Run regularly** - Weekly quick checks, monthly deep dives
3. **Track progress** - Save assessment results over time
4. **Share results** - Use `/generate-report` for leadership updates

### Implementation Best Practices
1. **Follow the levels** - Each builds on the previous
2. **Fix tagging first** - It's the foundation for everything else
3. **Use templates** - Don't reinvent the wheel
4. **Document everything** - Use notebook templates for incidents

### Tool Usage
1. **Use slash commands** - Pre-built and tested
2. **Save to Datadog** - Use `/save-to-notebook` for collaboration
3. **Refer to planning docs** - When you need details
4. **Check COMMANDS.md** - For syntax and examples

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Datadog MCP not found"
- Install Datadog MCP server: https://docs.datadoghq.com/bits_ai/mcp_server/setup/
- Verify configuration in Claude Code settings

### "Permission denied" errors
- Check API key permissions
- Ensure read access to all Datadog resources
- Verify API key is not expired

### Assessment shows unexpected low scores
- Check tagging compliance - it's often the culprit
- Verify data is flowing (agents reporting, logs ingesting)
- Run `/assess-full` for detailed breakdown

### Commands not found
- Commands are in `.claude/commands/` directory
- Use `/help` to list all available commands
- Check that you're using slash syntax: `/assess` not `assess`

---
